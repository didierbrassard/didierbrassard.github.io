I am a CIHR postdoctoral research fellow at McGill University at the School of Human Nutrition. My current research interests are nutritional epidemiology and aging; I am working with Prof. St√©phanie Chevalier to document the adequacy of current Canadian dietary guidelines in older adults. I am also interested in statistical modelling of dietary intakes, measurement error correction as well as causal inference.  

The purpose of my blog is to share my research, but also what I have learned about data visualization, epidemiology and coding along the way. I hope my articles help you save time and learn new tricks.
