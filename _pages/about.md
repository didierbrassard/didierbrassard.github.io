I am a Professor of Nutrition at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières.
My current research interests are nutritional epidemiology and aging with applications with applications in population surveillance and the study of diet–health relationships.
I am particularly interested in the statistical modelling of dietary intakes, correction of measurement error and causal inference.

Through this blog, I share my research as well as practical insights on data visualization, epidemiology, and coding.
My goal is to help others save time and learn useful techniques.

Feel free to contact me for questions or potential collaborations.
