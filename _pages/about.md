I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Montreal Heart Institute (Université de Montréal). My current research interests are nutritional epidemiology and aging with applications in both surveillance and epidemiology. I am also interested in statistical modelling of dietary intakes, measurement error correction as well as causal inference.  

The purpose of my blog is to share my research, but also what I have learned about data visualization, epidemiology and coding along the way. I hope my articles help you save time and learn new tricks.
