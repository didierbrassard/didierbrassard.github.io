The objective of this study was to evaluate the construct validity and reliability of the Healthy Eating Food Index-2019 (HEFI-2019)

The HEFI-2019 scoring algorithm is [available on my GitHub page](https://github.com/didierbrassard/hefi2019). The "official" version is a SAS macro, but I also provide an adaptation coded in R. Feel free to suggest improvements to the R version!I  have also published [an example application in SAS](https://github.com/didierbrassard/hefi2019/tree/master/Example_SAS_cchs) of the HEFI-2019 using dietary intake data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2015 - Nutrition. The example shows how to prepare CCHS data file, classify foods according to the HEFI-2019 categories, calculate sum, calculate mean HEFI-2019 scores as well as how to apply more sophisticated methods to derive distribution of HEFI-2019 score based on usual intakes.
