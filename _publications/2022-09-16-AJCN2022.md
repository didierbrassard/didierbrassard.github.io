The aim of this study was to examine how greater adherence to the 2019 CFG&apos;s recommendations on healthy food choices influences the risk of incident CVD.

SAS codes for the main analysis as well as the RMarkdown files (main text and supplemental material) are publicly available in
<a href='https://github.com/didierbrassard/hefi2019_cvd'>the *hefi2019_cvd* GitHub repository</a>. The code provided shows how to use the National Cancer Institute multivariate method to obtain usual intake distribution for the Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI)-2019 as well as measurement error-corrected estimates of the HEFI2019-cardiovascular disease relationship.
