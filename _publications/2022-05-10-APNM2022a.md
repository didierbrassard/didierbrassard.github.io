This study describes the development and scoring standards of the Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI-2019)

The HEFI-2019 scoring algorithm is [available on my GitHub page](https://github.com/didierbrassard/hefi2019). The "official" version is a SAS macro, but I also provide an adaptation coded in R. Feel free to suggest improvements to the R version!
