The aim was to assess the relationship between adherence to CFG recommendations on healthy food choices and intake of key nutrients in adults 65 years and older from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2015 - Nutrition.	

SAS codes for the main analysis as well as the Quarto documents to generate the main text and supplemental material are [publicly available on Github](https://github.com/didierbrassard/hefi2019_nutrient). The raw data and results are [publicly available on OSF](https://osf.io/6na42/). The code provided shows how to use the National Cancer Institute multivariate method to obtain usual intake distribution for the Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI)-2019 and estimate relationship with nutrient intakes.
