In this nutrition data visualization series, I aim to show how to
visualize common statistics in health and nutrition. Or, at least, how I
think it is best to visualize these data.  
In this article, I focus on examples of means and difference of means.

To focus on the graph *per se* and not data manipulation, I use summary
statistics data that is ready for presentation from a previous paper of
mine, [the evaluation of the Healthy Eating Food Index
(HEFI)-2019](https://didierbrassard.github.io/publication/2022-05-10-APNM2022b).
Also, note that I will not describe how to plot all underlying
observations, since I am using survey data (\>20,000 respondents).
However, it is often optimal to show the underlying data points -
perhaps something I can present in a future post.

# Data overview

The data shows HEFI-2019 score based on usual intakes and respondents
from the CCHS-2015 Nutrition. HEFI-2019 score indicates the extent to
which dietary intakes are consistent with Canada’s Food Guide
recommendations on healthy food choices. Thus, HEFI-2019 scores reflect
diet quality according to Canadian recommendations.  
The summary statistics (mean and distribution) are presented by age (4 y
or older) and sex groups (males, females). In the code below, I import
data and apply some formatting. You can skip to the next section to see
visualization code only.

``` r
# Load libraries
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Set theme for all plots
theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw())

# Import and prepare data for examples
distrib_hefi2019 <-
  # using <read_sas> function to read the SAS dataset
  haven::read_sas("./post_data/distribtotal_t_drigf.sas7bdat") |>
  # keep relevant variables, groups and statistics only
  filter(name=="Mean",drig>2) |> 
  select(drig,estimate,se,lcl95,ucl95,estimate_ci,estimate_se) |>
  # some corrections for clarity
  mutate(# change ordering for consistency
        drig = ifelse(drig>9000,drig+1,drig),
        # change value of reference level for difference
        se = ifelse(drig==9993,NA,se),
        lcl95 = ifelse(drig==9993,NA,lcl95),
        ucl95 = ifelse(drig==9993,NA,ucl95),
        estimate_ci = ifelse(drig==9993,"Reference",estimate_ci),
        estimate_se = ifelse(drig==9993,"Reference",estimate_se)
        )

# Add labels to the <drig> variable
distrib_hefi2019$drig_f <- 
  factor(distrib_hefi2019$drig,
         levels = distrib_hefi2019$drig,
         labels = c('4-8 y',
                    'Male, 9-13 y',
                    'Female, 9-13 y',

# Traditional plot: bar chart for means and differences

A common way to present means is the infamous dynamite plot or bar
chart. Bar height reflect means and a measure of dispersion is often
added, either standard deviation or standard errors. In the present
example, I show standard errors, since we are using survey data.

## Traditional plot 1: mean score

``` r
# Mean score only

distrib_hefi2019 |> 
  filter(drig<9000) |> # note: focus on mean score
ggplot(aes(x=drig_f,y=estimate),stat="identity") + 
  geom_col(width=0.5,color="black",fill="#e67424") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=estimate,ymax=estimate+se),width=0.3) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,60)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=-50, size=8,hjust=-0.1)) +
    # note: angle used to avoid overlapping axis text
  labs(title = "HEFI-2019 mean score",
       subtitle = "CCHS-2015 Nutrition respondents 4y+",
       x=NULL,y="HEFI-2019 score, points")
```

## Traditional plot 2: difference of means

``` r
# Mean score difference

distrib_hefi2019 |> 
  filter(drig>9000) |> # note: focus on mean score difference
ggplot(aes(x=drig_f,y=estimate),stat="identity") + 
  geom_col(width=0.5,color="black",fill="#8d1c06") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=estimate-se,ymax=estimate+se),width=0.3) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=-50, size=8,hjust=-0.1)) +
    # note: angle used to avoid overlapping axis text
  labs(title = "HEFI-2019 mean score differences",
       subtitle = "CCHS-2015 Nutrition respondents 4y+",
       x=NULL,
       y="HEFI-2019 score, points")

## What is suboptimal?

While there is nothing inherently wrong with the plots above, it is not
a good use of space. In other words, there is a lot of “ink” to convey
little information. Plus, vertical bars are not the best to show
ranking. Again, it is not dramatic, but it is nonetheless hard to see
what is actually happening at a glance.  
Let’s try to interpret results to see why our traditional bar plots are
not optimal. Based on the mean difference bar plot (second plot), try to
answer the following questions:

-   Compared with the 4-8 y group (reference), which age/sex group has
    the **best** diet quality?
-   Which group has the **second** **best** diet quality?
-   The **third** **best** diet quality?

Now, inversely,

-   Compared with the 4-8 y group (reference), which age/sex group has
    the **worst** diet quality?
-   Which group has the **second** **worst** diet quality?
-   The **third worst** diet quality?

Perhaps answering the first question was not so hard. However, the
interpretation does get harder as we refine questions. Fortunately, we
can improve our plots to facilitate their reading.

# Enhanced plots: a better way

To improve the plots above, there are a couple of simple things we can
do:

1.  **Order groups by differences** (or mean) to see ranking;
2.  Use **dots** instead of bars;
3.  Use **95% confidence intervals** instead of standard errors;
4.  Show categories on the **Y** axis instead of X.

The ordering helps reader understand age/sex subgroups that are the most
different from one another or the reference cateogry. The dots clearly
identify the mean value. While Standard Deviation may be useful to show
dispersion, 95%CI are a better choice to show differences of mean.
Indeed, the CI reflect all values compatible with the data and thus will
help understand the extent of those differences. Finally, the plotting
of age/sex subgroups on the Y axis increases readability.

## Enhanced plot 1: mean score

``` r
# Mean score only
distrib_hefi2019 |> 
  filter(drig<9000) |>
  # (1) groups are ordered using <reorder> function
ggplot(aes(x=reorder(drig_f,estimate,na.rm=TRUE),y=estimate),stat="identity") + 
  # (2) <geom_point> replaces <geom_col>
  geom_point(color="#e67424",size=3) +
  # (3) <geom_linerange> used to display 95%CI
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin=lcl95,ymax=ucl95),colour="#e67424") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(35,50),breaks=seq(30,50,5)) +
  # (4) categories plotted on the Y axis
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "HEFI-2019 mean score",
       subtitle = "CCHS-2015 Nutrition respondents 4y+",
       x=NULL,y="HEFI-2019 score, points")
```

<img src="/images/2022-09-22-blog-post-2_files/figure-gfm/enhanced-plot1-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Enhanced plot 2: differences of mean

``` r
# Mean score difference

distrib_hefi2019 |> 
  filter(drig>9000) |> 
  # (1) groups are ordered using <reorder> function
ggplot(aes(x=reorder(drig_f,estimate,na.rm=TRUE),y=estimate),stat="identity") + 
  #  (Bonus) add reference line at 0 for null difference
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype="longdash",color="gray") +
  # (2) <geom_point> replaces <geom_col>
  geom_point(color="#8d1c06",size=3) + 
  # (3) <geom_linerange> used to display 95%CI
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin=lcl95,ymax=ucl95),color="#8d1c06") +
  # (4) categories plotted on the Y axis
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-2.5,10,2.5)) +
  labs(title = "HEFI-2019 mean score differences",
       subtitle = "CCHS-2015 Nutrition respondents 4y+",
       x=NULL,
       y="HEFI-2019 score, points")
```

<img src="/images/2022-09-22-blog-post-2_files/figure-gfm/enhanced-plot2-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Now, try to answer the same questions, but based on the enhanced mean
difference plot:

-   Compared with the 4-8 y group (reference), which age/sex group has
    the **best** diet quality?
-   Which group has the **second** **best** diet quality?
-   The **third** **best** diet quality?

Inversely,

-   Compared with the 4-8 y group (reference), which age/sex group has
    the **worst** diet quality?
-   Which group has the **second** **worst** diet quality?
-   The **third worst** diet quality?

Much easier isn’t it? The simple changes made above will help readers
interpret the data. Both enhanced plots look very similar, but usually
we would present the one that is the most consistent with the study
objective, either ordered means or ordered differences.

You might also say that perhaps I could have ordered the bar charts the
same way that I did with the dot plot; or that I could have used 95%CI
for the bar chart too; or that I could have used horizontal bar charts.
While all of this is true, the bar chart would still not be the *best*
use of space. Dots are also better to visualize ranking (Cleveland,
1993).
