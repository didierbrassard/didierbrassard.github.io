In this **Code for Lazy People** blog series, I share coding tools that
make my daily work more efficient — because, honestly, I prefer to work
smarter, not harder. Like many researchers, I often deal with repetitive
tasks, and instead of doing them manually, I use code to automate them.
Over time, I have built a collection of such tools that help me save
time and effort. That’s one of the things I love about coding: once you
create a solution, you can recycle it for future projects instead of
reinventing the wheel every time.

# Code headings

One of such repetitive tasks is to create code section separated by text
and visual symbols. For example, say you want to highlight a particular
code section where you will prepare your data. You could write something
like:

``` r
# Data preparation for main analysis A
```

While this is good enough for short codes, it may be hard to track this
section visually once you have a few hundred more lines. In that case,
you may write something like:

``` r
######################################
# Data preparation for main analysis A
######################################
```

The additional formatting helps you track visually each section within a
code file. Yet, it becomes fairly annoying to manually align everything
to ensure that each section is consistent in length and shape.

``` r
######################################
# Data preparation for main analysis A
######################################

# ...

############################################
# Data preparation for main analysis B and C
############################################

# ...


##########################################
# Save processed data for further analysis
##########################################

# ...


####################################################################
# Save processed data for further analysis with a fancier encasing #
####################################################################

# ...
```

The examples above are also good enough for short titles. However, when
I am actively writing code, I find it unpractical to always re-write the
comment symbol a few times `####`, then copy-paste it a few times, and
manually align everything.

Naturally, I made a function that automatically does that:

1.  create code heading with (customizable) symbols;
2.  auto-align spacing for a given (customizable) length, so that
    symbols and text are always consistent;
3.  allows for additional white lines for larger visual delimitation.
4.  automatically copy the resulting heading so you can `CTRL+V`
    directly in your document after execution.

# `make_title` R function

You can copy and paste the code below, save it in a `.R` script, and run
it before you wish to use it. [You can also download the script
here.](https://didierbrassard.github.io/files/blog2025_01.R)

``` r
#' @title Make Titles for Codes
#'
#' @description Generate heading or title as comments to organize R script
#'
#' @param title The text that will be used as the heading
#' @param total_width The total width of the heading, including the symbol characters and spaces. The default is 75.
#' @param left_aligned A logical value indicating whether the title should be left-aligned within the heading (TRUE) or centered (FALSE). The default is FALSE.
#' @param blank_line The number of blank lines to be added before and after the heading. The default is 0.
#' @param symbol The symbol character used to create the heading. The default is <*>.
#'
#' @return An R comment message with the title that is also copied to clipboard.
#'
#' @examples #make_title("Introducing: the <make_title> function",blank_line=1)
#'
#' @importFrom clipr write_clip
#' @export

make_title <- function(title,total_width=75,left_aligned=FALSE,blank_line=0,symbol='*'){

  # output n stars, title width + half, n blanks
  n_stars <- total_width-2
  title_width <- nchar(title)

  # Hard stop if title too long
  if(title_width > (total_width-5)) {
    new_try <- title_width+5
    message(paste("ERROR: Current title is too large to fit with a <total_width> of",total_width))
    message(paste("Tip: Try a <total_width> of",new_try,"instead"))
    stop()
  }

  title_width_half <- title_width/2
  n_blanks <- total_width-4

  # find heading center
  heading_center <-  floor(n_blanks/2)

  # calculate blanks to the right and to the left of title
  left_blanks <- ifelse(left_aligned==FALSE,heading_center-title_width_half,0)
  right_blanks <-
    ifelse(left_aligned==FALSE,
           ifelse(title_width %% 2 == 0, # +/- 1 depending on even/uneven title length
                  n_blanks - (left_blanks+title_width)-1,
                  n_blanks - (left_blanks+title_width))+1,
           n_blanks - (left_blanks+title_width))

  # make vector of blanks
  symbol_vector <- paste0(replicate(n_blanks,symbol),collapse="")
  blank_vector <-  paste0(replicate(n_blanks," "),collapse="")
  left_blanks_vector <- paste0(replicate(left_blanks," "),collapse="")
  right_blanks_vector <- paste0(replicate(right_blanks," "),collapse="")

  # Create heading
  row1 <- paste0('# ',symbol_vector,' #')
  row2 <- paste0('# ',left_blanks_vector,title,right_blanks_vector,' #')
  row3 <- paste0('# ',symbol_vector,' #')
  row0 <- paste0('# ',blank_vector,' #')

  # Output heading
  message(row1)
  if(blank_line>0) message(row0)
  message(row2)
  if(blank_line>0) message(row0)
  message(row3)

  # copy to clipboard
  if(blank_line>0) {
    to_copy <- c(row1,rep(row0,blank_line), row2,rep(row0,blank_line), row3)
    clipr::write_clip(to_copy,breaks="\n")
  } else {
    to_copy <- c(row1,row2,row3)
    clipr::write_clip(to_copy,breaks="\n")
  } # end of copy to clipboard

}
```

As you can see, the function is neither very complicated nor fancy. The
most “advanced” feature - to automatically transfer the resulting
heading to copy/paste - is actually performed using the [`clipr`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clipr/index.html). I
typically use the function directly in the console and not necessarily
in the code file per se. In other words, I don’t track how I generated
the titles, since I am only using the resulting text in my codes.

Before we dive in some examples, I want to point out that I found after
the fact that an R package for that already existed. I have never used
it, but you can check
[`bannerCommenter`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bannerCommenter/index.html)
on Cran.

# Example 1: Large heading at the top of a code file

Sometimes it is useful to include a large heading at the top of a code
`.R` code file to describe what it is about. For such code, we will
added 2 blank lines using `blank_line=2`. The actual title does not
matter, as long as it fits within the character length specified in
`total_width`, that is, 75 by default.

``` r
# Code I would enter in the console to generate a heading for a code file
make_title("Code 01 - Initial data preparation", blank_line=2)
```

    # *********************************************************************** #
    #                                                                         #
    #                   Code 01 - Initial data preparation                    #
    #                                                                         #
    # *********************************************************************** #

A preview is shown in the console, but it will not show all blank lines
for tidyness. The actual result that would be pasted in the code file is
shown below:

``` r
# *********************************************************************** #
#                                                                         #
#                                                                         #
#                   Code 01 - Initial data preparation                    #
#                                                                         #
#                                                                         #
# *********************************************************************** #
```

# Example 2: Small heading at the top of a code section

Next, we may want to separate code section that perform different tasks
within a code file.

``` r
# Code I would enter in the console to generate a heading for a code section
make_title("Data preparation for data A")
```

    # *********************************************************************** #
    #                      Data preparation for data A                        #
    # *********************************************************************** #

Since we do not have blank lines, the resulting text is consistent with
the preview:

``` r
# *********************************************************************** #
#                      Data preparation for data A                        #
# *********************************************************************** #
```

We can also reduce the total width for subsections. For example, I can
generate a subheading with a total width of 50 characters,
`total_width=50`.

``` r
# Code I would enter in the console to generate a subheading for a code section
make_title("Import raw data", 50)
```

    # ********************************************** #
    #                Import raw data                 #
    # ********************************************** #

Again, the resulting text is consistent with the preview:

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#                Import raw data                 #
# ********************************************** #
```

# Example 3: Further customization

There are many ways in which you could customize your headings for
different purpose. I present a two options.

``` r
# Using a different symbol
make_title("Further customization", symbol="-")
```

    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #
    #                         Further customization                           #
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #

``` r
# Using a left alignment
make_title("Author: Last name, first name", left_aligned = TRUE)
```

    # *********************************************************************** #
    # Author: Last name, first name                                           #
    # *********************************************************************** #

# Example 4: combination with RStudio’s built-in code sections

RStudio also includes a built-in approach to separate code section using
at least four comment symbols `####`. I often combine both the RStudio
approach and large comment headings to benefit from the advantages of
both.

``` r
#### First step in my code ####
# *********************************************************************** #
#                   This is the first step in my code                     #
# *********************************************************************** #

  # ...

##### This is the first substep #####
# ********************************************** #
#           This is the first substep            #
# ********************************************** #

  # ...
```

Now, I would agree that the combination of both may be a bit overkill.
Nonetheless, I do believe it helps me organize longer codes more easily!
I think that having a clear outline really helps others to navigate
through your code. Or maybe even yourself in a few months/years from
now.
