In this nutrition data visualization series, I aim to show how to
visualize common statistics in health and nutrition. Or, at least, how I
think it is best to visualize these data.  
In this article, I focus on the case where we are interested in
**proportions**. Often, we want to compare two proportions. In a survey,
proportions (named prevalence) are compared using prevalence ratio; in a
cohort study, proportions (named risks) are compared using risk ratios.
Other examples of summary statistics for proportions include odds ratio
(e.g., case-control study), hazard ratios (e.g., survival analysis),
etc.

The graph I like to use for an efficient visualization of ratios is a
combination of three panels: two dot plots and summary statistics. The
first panel presents the crude proportions for the group being compared
while the second panel presents the measure of association (i.e., ratio
of proportions). The panel of summary statistics provide exact numbers.
All three panels can be generated using the `ggplot2` package and then
combined with the `patchwork` package.

# Data Overview

For the purpose of this blog, I use data published in the article
entitled [*Estimating the effect of nutritional interventions using
observational data: the American Heart Association’s 2020 Dietary Goals
and mortality*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34041538/) (Chiu et
al. 2021). I suggest you read the article if you are interested in
causal inference methods applied to nutrition - or any other lifestyle
habits.

More specifically, I retrieve data directly from **Table 4**. The table
presents all-cause mortality risks under “no intervention/no change” or
a “hypothetical nutrition interventions” in 3 large cohorts from the US.
In this example, the proportions are risks and the corresponding ratios
are risk ratios.

The risk ratios indicate the extent to which the all-cause mortality
risk is modified upon adhering to “hypothetical” nutrition intervention
in these cohorts.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#        Manually input table information        #
# ********************************************** #

# note: 
# risk0 = risk under no intervention
# risk1 = risk under hypothetical intervention

chiu2021 <- 
  tibble::tribble(
  ~cohort, ~risk0, ~risk1, ~rr_estimate, ~rr_lcl, ~rr_ucl,
  1, 25.8, 21.9, 0.85, 0.81, 0.88,
  2, 12.6, 10.0, 0.79, 0.75, 0.85,
  3, 2.5, 2.1, 0.86, 0.78, 0.96)

# add cohort name as factor
chiu2021$cohort_f <- 
  factor(
    chiu2021$cohort,
    levels = c(1, 2, 3),
    labels = c("Health Professionals Follow-Up Study",
               "Nurses’ Health Study",
               "Nurses’ Health Study-II"))

# overview
head(chiu2021)
```

    # A tibble: 3 × 7
      cohort risk0 risk1 rr_estimate rr_lcl rr_ucl cohort_f                         
       <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>       <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <fct>

Notice that I entered the risks in the “wide” format, i.e., on the same
rows to facilitate data entry. For the first panel, some data
manipulations are needed to obtain a “tidy” data set where each
observation are rows.

# Dot plots and summary statistics

## Panel 1: crude proportions

The first dot plot shows the crude proportions for each group (“no
intervention/no change” or “intervention”). In other words, the
prevalence or risk within each group separately. In the code below, I
transform the data from wide to tall/long and generate the dot plot.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#              Load packages needed              #
# ********************************************** #

library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

# set default theme to <theme_bw> and increase base text size to 12 pts
ggplot2::theme_set(theme_bw(base_size=12))

# ********************************************** #
#              Prepare 'tidy' data               #
# ********************************************** #

chiu2021_long <-
  chiu2021 |>
  # remove variables not needed for first panel
  dplyr::select(-tidyr::starts_with("rr")) |> 
  # transform proportions to tall/long data (instead of wide)
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c("risk0","risk1"),
    values_to = "risk",
    names_to  = "scenario"
  )

# factorize the scenario
chiu2021_long$scenario_f <-
  factor(chiu2021_long$scenario,
         levels = c("risk0", "risk1"),
         labels = c("No change",
                    "Intervention")
  )

# overview
head(chiu2021_long)
```

## Panel 2: (risk) ratios

The second panel shows the ratios, i.e., the comparison between the two
proportions. In this example, the comparison between the two proportions
is the risk ratio.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#  Use ggplot to generate second dot plot panel  #
# ********************************************** #

#note: data transformations are not needed here since there is only 1 statistic per cohort

panel2 <- 
  chiu2021 |>
  ggplot(aes(y=cohort_f, x=rr_estimate)) + 
  geom_point(shape=15, size=3) + # square shape used to differentiate vs. risk
  geom_vline(xintercept=1, linetype="dashed", color="gray") + # null effect estimates
  scale_x_log10() + # ensure proper comparison when there are RR<1 and RR>1
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin=rr_lcl, xmax=rr_ucl)) +
  labs(x="20-year risk ratio\n of all-cause mortality",y="Cohort")

# show output
  panel2
```

## Panel 3: summary statistics

The third panel shows the summary statistics, i.e., the risk ratio
estimates and their 95% confidence interval. While the second panel
above already presents this information, some readers may prefer to have
the exact numerical values.

The code below shows how to generate the numerical values while ensuring
that they are aligned with the other panels.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#       Create special theme for text only       #
# ********************************************** #

# note: I initially found this solution somewhere online,
# but I can't find the reference... 

theme_table <-function(){
  theme(#plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5), ## centering (sub)title on text
  axis.text.x=element_text(color="white"),
  axis.line=element_blank(),
  axis.text.y=element_blank(),axis.ticks=element_blank(),
  axis.title.y=element_blank(),
  legend.position="none",
  panel.background=element_blank(),
  panel.border=element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major=element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),
  plot.background=element_blank()
  )
}

# ********************************************** #
#     Use ggplot to generate panel of stat.      #
# ********************************************** #

panel3 <- chiu2021 |>
  # combine estimate with 95CI 
  dplyr::mutate(
    estimate_ci = paste0(rr_estimate," (", rr_lcl, ", ", rr_ucl,")")
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(y=cohort_f)) +
  labs(y=NULL,x="  ") +
  theme_table() + 
  geom_text(aes(x=0, label=estimate_ci, fontface=2), hjust = 0 ,size=4) + xlim(0,1)

panel3
```

<img src="/images/2023-05-15-blog-post-4_files/figure-commonmark/panel3-1.png"
style="width:80.0%" data-fig-align="center"
alt="Risk ratio estimates (95%CI) under ‘hypothetical intervention’ vs., instead, ‘no intervention’ in 3 cohorts from the US. Data from Chiu et al. Am J Clin Nutr 2021." />

# Combining the three panels

Now that the three panels are created, we can use the `patchwork`
package to generate the final three-panel figure. With `patchwork`,
simple arithmetic operators are used to combine the indiviudal ggplot
objects. For example, `panel1 + panel2 + panel3`.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#         Combine panels with patchwork          #
# ********************************************** #

panel_combined <- 
  panel1 + 
  (panel2 + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
                  axis.text.y = element_blank(),
                  axis.ticks.y = element_blank())) +
  # note: labels in the second panel are removed since they already appear in panel 1
  panel3
  
panel_combined
```

<img src="/images/2023-05-15-blog-post-4_files/figure-commonmark/combine-1.png"
style="width:100.0%" data-fig-align="center"
alt="Risks and risk ratio under ‘hypothetical intervention’ vs., instead, ‘no intervention’ in 3 cohorts from the US. Data from Chiu et al. Am J Clin Nutr 2021." />

# Conclusion

Although the final graph is a bit plain, I believe it would be suitable
for publication in a scientific journal. Indeed, it clearly shows the
crude risk within each group, their ratio, as well as the confidence
interval. The summary statistics on the right allow readers to have full
information. It is an efficient use of space and the horizontal dots and
lines facilitate effect size comparisons. Of note, the three-panel
approach also works well to present mean and difference of means among
two groups, as long as units are consistent across categories on the
Y-axis.

One caveat is that the current arrangement of panels makes it
challenging to compare more than 2 groups. For instance, if we had three
interventions, it would be difficult to show all pairwise comparisons.

Finally, for presentation purpose, it might be nicer to add colours,
annotations or highlight specific estimates; `ggplot2` offers many
possibilities for customization. We could also have reordered the risk
ratio estimate to rank them by effect size (using `stats::reorder`), but
it was not essential in the present example as there were only three
categories (“Cohort”) on the Y-axis.
