For descriptive purpose, we may want to plot and compare many
differences for variables with varying units. Nutrient intakes are a
common example where we may have data measured in calories (e.g.,
energy), grams (e.g., saturated fats) or servings (e.g., sugar-sweetened
beverages). However, the extent of the difference - the effect size -
cannot be easily compared when units and scales vary. Percentage
difference and log-transformation of data may be helpful to facilitate
result presentation.

In addition, data transformation are commonly used to better satisfy
assumptions of regression models. The log transformation is helpful,
given that it is interpreted correctly.

# Types of percentage difference

## Traditional

Typically, the percentage difference is calculated as a difference over
a reference value. For example, say we measured mean energy intake
intake in a control group (group=0; 2500 kcal) as well as in an
intervention group (group=1; 3000 kcal), we may calculate the percentage
difference in mean energy as:

$$\text{percentage}_\text{diff.}=\frac{X_1-X_0}{X_0}\cdot100$$

For the example above, \\(X\\) is the energy intake and the (traditional)
percentage difference is

$$\frac{3000-2500}{2500}=\frac{500}{2500}\cdot100=20\%$$

However, the choice of the reference value is not always
straightforward, especially when there is no clear time ordering or
reference value. For example, had we decided to use the mean energy
intake of group 1 as the reference, we would have obtained a 16.7%
percentage difference.

## Reference invariant

An alternative percentage difference that does not vary according to the
choice of the reference value is (Cole & Altman, 2017a):

$$\text{percentage}_\text{diff.}=\frac{X_1-X_0}{\mu_{(X_0, X_1)}}\cdot100$$

where \\(\mu\\) is the mean. For the example above, the (symmetrical)
percentage difference is

$$\frac{3000-2500}{\mu_{(3000,2500)}}=\frac{500}{2750}=18.2\%$$

This alternative calculation does not depend on which value we use as
reference and is symmetrical.

Unfortunately, both the traditional and reference invariant difference
have an important drawback: they are not additive.

## Log-based

Cole & Altman (2017b) present an elegant solution based on
log-transformation: *“if we take two numbers a and b, then the
difference between their logs, \\(ln(a)−ln(b)\\), is the fractional
difference between a and b”*.

For all values greater than zero, we can use this convenient natural
logarithm rule to calculate percentage difference. Of note, the use of
natural logarithm for this task is important as it will circumvent the
need to back-transform the difference. In other words, using natural
logarithm permits a direct interpretation of the result (Cole, 2000).

$$\text{percentage}_\text{diff.}=({ln(X_1)-ln(X_0)}) \cdot 100$$

For the example above, the (symmetrical and additive) log-based
percentage difference is

$$({\text{ln}(3000)-\text{ln}(2500)})\cdot100=(8.01-7.82)\cdot100=19\%$$

This alternative calculation does not depend on the reference value. It
is also symmetrical and additive. More details are available regarding
this property of the natural logarithm (Cole, 2000).

# Example application: difference of means between two groups

Nutrient intake data are good candidates for the log transformation as
nutrient intake values are always positive and most often greater than
zero. For example, nutrient intake differences between two groups can be
calculated on a common percentage scale by 1) calculating log values of
the nutrients for the two groups, and 2) then the difference of the
log-transformed nutrient values between groups. The percentage
differences can then be plotted on a common axis, which helps us
appreciate the extent of differences.

Another feature of data transformation is to better satisfy linear
regression model assumptions. For example, one may transform a
continuous \\(Y\\) to \\(\text{log}(Y)\\) to obtain model errors that are
approximately identically and normally distributed. Contrary to other
transformations, the log transformation is the only transformation that
can have an intuitive interpretation once we back-transform (i.e, take
the antilog or exponentiate) the effect estimates obtained based on
log-transformed outcome data. Furthermore, using natural logarithm
(\\(\text{log}_e(Y)\\) or \\(\text{ln}(Y)\\)) also circumvent the need to
back-transform data as described above (Cole, 2000).

## Simulation

For demonstration purpose, I simulate nutrient intake data with varying
units: energy in calories, saturated fats in grams and sugar-sweetened
beverages in servings. In this example, there are two groups, i.e., a
control and intervention group. For both groups, we have estimated
nutrient intakes and we wish to know the difference in nutrient intakes
between groups.

On the original scale, plotting all differences would not be
informative. On the log-transformed scale, the percentage difference
makes it easy to compare effect size estimates. All in all, the log
transformation may improve model robustness and facilitate result
presentation.

[Figure 1](#fig-rawdata) presents an overview of the distribution among
the two groups.

Mean food and nutrient intakes and difference between groups

At this point, we have successfully calculated differences among groups
(assuming no confounding, no selection bias and no measurement error).
Although a table could suffice, I like graph.

## Percentage difference using linear regression models

In the code below, I use a linear regression model to estimate the
difference in nutrient intakes between groups. The linear regression
model has the equation:

$$\text{log}_e\text{(nutrient)}_i=\beta_0+\beta_\text{Group}\text{Group}_i+\epsilon_i$$

Since nutrients are expressed on the log scale, a change of 1 unit for
any independent variable now reflect a change in
\\(\text{log}_e\text{(nutrient)}\\), i.e., a percent difference! Indeed,
\\(\text{log}(a) - \text{log}(b) = \text{log} (\frac{a}{b})\\)

``` r
# package to loop analysis
library(purrr)

# ********************************************** #
#           Function for linear model            #

  # note: use a function to have consistent output

output_diff <- function(outcome,log=FALSE){
  # outcome : nutrient for which we want to know differences
  # log     : TRUE/FALSE indicating if outcome should be log-transformed
  
if(log==FALSE){
  # no transformation = raw data as outcome
model <- lm(sim_intervention[,outcome]~group, data=sim_intervention)
}else {
  # transformation = log outcome data (natural log by default)
model <- lm(log(sim_intervention[,outcome])~group,
            data=sim_intervention)
}
# the <parameters> function extract reg. coef. + 95CI

    3 ssbs    group          -0.443 -0.643 -0.242 

### Back-transformation

On one hand, natural logarithms were used in the example above to avoid
the need for a back-transformation. Natural logarithms are calculated by
default in R. On the other hand, had we used a different base for the
log transformation, say log10, the regression coefficient should have
been back-transformed to be interpreted as a percent difference.

Linear regression coefficients for a change in **\\(\text{log}_{10}\\)**
outcome can be back-transformed using the following equation:

$$\text{Percentage}_\text{diff.}=100 \cdot 10^{\beta_{X}}-100$$

where \\(\beta_{X}\\) represents the estimated regression coefficient based
on log-transformed outcome.

The same equation can also be used for the **\\(\text{log}_\text{e}\\)**
transformation:

$$\text{Percentage}_\text{diff.}=100 \cdot e^{\beta_{X}}-100$$

For example, we can back-transform the regression coefficient for the
simulated `energy` variable (\\(\beta_X=\\) -0.114) using the R code
`100*exp(lm_diff_log[1,3])-100`. We find that the estimated percent
difference in total energy intake between group is -11%. This result is
similar to the untransformed regression coefficient, since the natural
logarithm was used.

## Results and interpretation

Once percentage differences are calculated based on log-transformed
data, it is finally possible to plot and compare effect estimate on a
common axis.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#               Plot using ggplot2               #
# ********************************************** #

# make nicer label
lm_diff_log$outcome_f <-
  factor(lm_diff_log$outcome,
         levels = lm_diff_log$outcome,
         labels = c("Total energy",
         "Saturated fats",
         "Sugars-sweetened beverages"))

# combine estimate with 95%CI
lm_diff_log |>
  mutate(
    estimate_ci = paste0(
      scales::percent(Coefficient,accuracy=0.1),
      " (",scales::percent(CI_low,accuracy=0.1),", ",
      scales::percent(CI_high,accuracy=0.1),")")
  )  |>
  # plot data and text
  ggplot(aes(x=outcome_f,y=Coefficient)) + 
  geom_point() + # point estimate
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin=CI_low,ymax=CI_high)) + # 95%CI
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype="longdash", color="gray")+ #null value
  geom_text(aes(label=estimate_ci), size=3, nudge_x = 0.1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)) + 
  labs(x=NULL, y="Symmetric percentage difference") +
  coord_flip() +  # switch axis for clarity
  theme_bw(base_size=14)
```

In conclusion, [Figure 2](#fig-diff) clearly shows that the mean
difference is much larger for sugar-sweetened beverages than for energy
intake, followed by saturated fats. These observations were not explicit
based on values on the original scale.

As a final note, I want to point out that instead of a regression model,
I could have either calculated the “crude” difference between groups
(difference of mean of log data) and/or used a t test
(`t.test(log(energy) ~ group, data= sim_intervention)`). The results
would have been exactly the same as the linear regression model. The
linear model has the advantage of being more flexible, since covariates
can easily be added, although not shown in my example.
