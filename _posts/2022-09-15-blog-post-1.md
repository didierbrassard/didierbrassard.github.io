In combat sports like boxing or mixed martial arts, there is a saying
that talented athletes lack work ethic compared with less talented ones.
As if athletes with the most “raw talent” had a natural tendency to
become lazy over time and work less than athletes that were not as
gifted with natural “raw talent”.

As a young athlete, I used to believe that too. While nobody is great at
first, some athletes learned techniques and moves more quickly than
others. In turn, those athletes deemed more naturally talented also
seemed to take more time off between competitions and be less willing to
go the extra mile. Could it be that, upon realization that they were
naturally talented, some athletes thought that they did not have to work
as much as others to have competitive success? Are talented athletes
doomed to become lazy? Or…

## Could there be an alternative explanation?

Most of my research was oriented towards nutritional epidemiology during
my PhD. Identifying and learning about source of bias became an
important aspect of my work. I now realize that there might be an easy
explanation for the observation that “talented fighters are lazy”. This
explanation strikes me as a perfect example of **selection bias** (or,
more precisely, *collider-stratification bias*). This bias is very
common, but it is also counter-intuitive which makes it hard to spot.

## An informal description of *collider-stratification bias*

(Very) informally, *collider-stratification bias* is a bias, i.e., a
spurious association, that occurs when focusing on one thing that is
caused by other things. When we focus on the one thing, a spurious
association is created between the other things. I know this sounds more
confusing than anything else.

Say that for a combat sport practitioner to step in the ring one day (be
a **FIGHTER**), the practitioner has to have a mix of **TALENT** (e.g.,
natural athletic abilities) and **WORK** ethic (e.g., never miss
practice). This is depicted in the figure below, a causal graph. Both
**TALENT** and **WORK** contributes to and causes one to become a
**FIGHTER**.

<img src="/images/2022-09-15-blog-post-1_files/dag-selection-bias-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Assuming that my causal graph is correct, **FIGHTER** is a collider:
both arrows from **TALENT** and **WORK** collide into being a
**FIGHTER**. Considering only those that step in the ring is - in
epidemiological jargon - defined as conditioning on **FIGHTER** (or
stratifying by FIGHTER). Indeed, among all people that walk through the
gym doors, we unconsciously condition (or stratify) for individuals that
become **FIGHTER**. It is indeed easier to remember individuals that
spent months and years training and competing rather than others that
only practiced for a short period. And this is the key to
collider-stratification bias! Fighters are not a sample of individuals
representative of *all* the population in terms of natural talent and
work ethic. I will come back to this point in the next sections.

Of note, one nuance in the graph is that there is initially no
relationship between **TALENT** and **WORK**. In other words, I assume
that work ethic does not cause talent and vice versa. For example, the
fact that an individual has a high proportion of explosive muscle fibres
(a genetic factor potentially contributing to perceived talent) does not
affect one’s work ethic based on my graph. For the purpose of this
example, it is a plausible assumption that whatever genetic factors
contribute to natural raw talent is not something that should cancel
work ethic. On the contrary, if talent affected one’s work ethic
(**TALENT-\>WORK**), it could even push to work more (“*Oh I’m good at
this!*”-\>“*Let’s do more*”). Again, for the purpose of this example, we
will assume this does not happen. Inversely, work ethic cannot affect
one’s genetic.

## What is the impact of collider bias?

Using the model above, I can run a very simple simulation to show that,
once we focus only on those that become **FIGHTERS**, **TALENT** will
appear negatively correlated with **WORK**. In other words, we may have
the impression that natural talent causes athletes to lack work ethic.
In reality, this effect does not exist and is a perfect example of
collider bias!

``` r
# Set R seed to reproduce these results
set.seed(1234)

# Our simulation includes 1000 people (e.g., 1000 gym members)
n <- 1000

# Among those, 100 people (or only 10%) will actually become fighters (i.e., step in the ring)
p <- 0.1

# Simulating that TALENT and WORK are both independent and randomly distributed attributes in our population
talent <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
work <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Among ALL the practitioners, is natural "talent" correlated with "work" ethic?
corr_talent_work <- cor(talent,work,method = "spearman")
corr_talent_work
```

    [1] 0.06188338

In the simulation above, and based on all 1000 individuals, natural
talent has a weak correlation of +0.06 with work ethic.  
In the next code section, I combine both `talent` and `work` score in
`total`. Then, individuals in the top 10% of combined `total` score are
selected.

``` r
# Combine both "talent" and "work" into one single metric
total <- talent+work

  ## note: we now have a 1000 individuals with varying degree of "talent" and "work"

# Combine the variables (talent, work, total) into a single data
population <- 
  data.frame(
    talent = talent,
    work   = work,
    total  = total )

# Remember that only 10% (p) athletes become fighters. Based on the "total" variable,
# this means that fighters must have a talent+work total score of at least ...

 cut_off <- quantile(total,1-p)
 cut_off
```

         90% 
    1.784185 

``` r
# Visualize this cut-off 
 ggplot(data=population,aes(x=total),stat="identity") +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, aes(y=..density..), colour="black",fill="white") +
  geom_density(kernel="gaussian",fill="black",alpha=0.1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=cut_off,colour="#e76254",
             linetype="longdash",size=1.5) +
  labs(title = paste0("Distribution of natural talent and work ethic in ", n,
                      " combat sport practitioners"),
       x="Talent + work score",
       y="Proportion of population",
       caption="Individuals to the right of the dashed line are fighters") +
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="/images/2022-09-15-blog-post-1_files/combination-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
# Stratification: identify the top athletes that will step in the ring
 
population$fighter <- 
  ifelse( population$total >=cut_off, TRUE,FALSE)
  
  ## Confirm that only "p" individuals are actually fighters
  table(population$fighter)
```


    FALSE  TRUE 
      900   100 

Now, we can look at the correlation between `talent` and `work` in the
top 10% individuals sample based on their total `talent + work` score.

``` r
# Select only fighters (i.e., condition/stratify), calculate correlation
corr_among_fighters <- 
  population |>
  dplyr::filter(fighter==TRUE) |>
  dplyr::select(talent,work) |>
  cor(method = "spearman")

# And the correlation is ...
corr_among_fighters[1,2]
```

    [1] -0.6007201

In our sample of fighters, the correlation between **TALENT** and
**WORK** is -0.60! Recall that, in our full population, the same
correlation was almost 10-time weaker (0.06). Clearly, when looking only
at fighters, i.e., the top athlete that will eventually step in the
ring, natural **TALENT** seems negatively correlated with **WORK**
ethic. The common interpretation is that talent somehow causes fighters
to be lazy. However, this effect does *not* exist.

## Conclusion

The explanation is rather simple. Given that individuals in our
population are a combination of talent and work, it happens more often
that fighters will either have a lot of natural talent **OR** a great
work ethic. Since it is less frequent that fighters will score high for
**BOTH** attributes, talent and work will appear *inversely* correlated
in fighters. In other words, fighters (the top 10% athletes in our
population) more frequently have great natural talent **OR** great work
ethic, but less frequently have great natural talent **AND** great work
ethic at the same time. In real life, more than 2 things contribute to
one’s ability to compete in combat sports. The bias is not expected to
be as large as in the simulation, but it can probably explain some of
the perceived relationship.

``` r
# Visualize the bias in our population
  ggplot(data=population,aes(x = work, y = talent, color = fighter)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = fighter), alpha = 3/4) +
  geom_smooth(data = population |> filter(fighter == TRUE),
              method = "lm", fullrange = F,
              color = "#A82203", se = F, size = 1/2) +
  labs(
    x = "Work ethic score",
    y = "Natural talent score",
    title="Relationship between natural talent and work ethic",
    subtitle = paste0("Simulated population = ",n," combat sport practitioners"),
    caption = paste0("Red values are individuals with the top ",p*100,"% score of combined talent+work")
    ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "#A82203")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1, 19)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

There are tons of other examples of collider bias in real life (e.g.,
*handsome men are jerks!*); nice examples are [presented on Twitter at
