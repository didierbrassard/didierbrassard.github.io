Random measurement errors associated with short-term dietary assessment
instruments (e.g., 24-hour dietary recalls and food records) may cause
[unexpected
bias](https://didierbrassard.github.io/posts/2022/11/blog-post-6/)
depending on study objective and target statistic. Fortunately, there
are well established methods to mitigate the impact of random errors.
One of these methods is called **regression calibration**. In this blog,
I introduce the method and show how it can be applied to a simple
nutrition analysis.

# What is ‘regression calibration’ ?

Regression calibration is one of the statistical methods available to
correct the bias due to random errors. The method traditionally requires
one or many repeated measurements (Kirkpatrick et al. 2022). The method
consists of the regression of a repeat measurement on the first
measurement using a linear regression model (measurement error model).
This measurement error model allows to obtain a correction factor which
can then be used to calibrate the association of interest.

Regression calibration was first used to obtain unbiased regression
coefficient estimate in a linear regression of a continuous outcome on a
covariate measured with error, but the method also works well for
logistic or Cox regression models (Keogh et al. 2020).

I want to point out that comprehensive methods have been developed for
nutrition analyses, including the [National Cancer Institute (NCI)
methods](https://didierbrassard.github.io/teaching/2022-12-nci-1).
Example applications for the National Cancer Institute methods are
available at [Software for Measurement Error in Nutrition
Research](https://prevention.cancer.gov/research-groups/biometry/measurement-error-impact/software-measurement-error).
The NCI methods also cover a wide range of application and are not
limited to regression models. Informally, the NCI methods are very fancy
and powerful applications of regression calibration designed for a
variety of analysis.

## Requirements and assumptions

The regression calibration method has statistical assumptions and
requirements. In the list below, \\(i\\) refers to a given individual and
\\(j\\) refers to a given short-term measurement of dietary intakes (e.g., a
24-h dietary recall or food records). Regression calibration:

1.  Requires at least 50 repeated measurements over non-consecutive days
    (\\(n_{i,j=2}\ge 50\\); Kirkpatrick et al. 2022 for details);
2.  Requires satisfying the classical measurement error model
    assumptions:
    1.  Random errors are normally distributed
        \\(E_{j} \sim N(\mu=0,\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2})\\);
    2.  Random errors across repeat measurements are independent
        (non-consecutive days) \\(E_{j=1} \perp E_{j=2}\\);
    3.  Random errors are independent of covariates included, if any
        \\(E_{ij} \perp Z_{i}\\);
3.  The random errors structure (i.e., the variation of intakes from one
    day to another) is generalizable to the full sample or specific
    subgroup (e.g., by sex);

Applying a measurement error correction method also requires us to
assume that the self-reported dietary intakes are unbiased. In other
words, that self-reported dietary intakes measured with the short-term
dietary assessment instrument are the true intakes (Kirkpatrick et
al. 2022). We know this assumption is not exactly correct (people tend
to underreport their intakes), but it is a working assumption.

# Example application: one independent variable measured with error

A common study objective is to estimate the relationship between a
dietary factor, as independent variable, and an outcome, as dependent
variable. For a continuous outcome, the estimand is $E(Y|X)$ or the
expected value of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\). For such analysis, we could be
interested in the relationship between intake of vegetables and fruits
(servings/day) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol
concentrations as outcome; an association was found previously (Djousse
et al. 2004). For this example, we will estimate the expected LDL
cholesterol concentrations based on the intake of vegetables and fruits
in a sample of the population (\\(n=5000\\)).

We could measure vegetables and fruits intake with 24-h dietary recall
data since this instrument has minimal systematic error (Thompson et
al. 2015). Knowing that 24-hour dietary recalls are affected by random
errors, we collect a second 24-hour dietary recall to apply correction
methods. Of note, to isolate the impact of random errors, I assume that
LDL cholesterol concentrations are measured perfectly and that there is
no source of bias (no confounding, no selection bias, no differential
errors,…).

To assess the relationship between vegetables and fruits and LDL
cholesterol, we would use a linear regression model corresponding to

$$Y_i=\beta_0 + \beta_{X_i} X_i +\epsilon_i$$

However, a naive analysis
ignoring random errors would rather have the estimand \\(E(Y|W_j)\\) and
model equation

$$Y_i=\beta\prime_0 + \beta\prime_{W_i} W_i +\epsilon_i$$

## Generate data

In this simulation, each increase of 1 serving of vegetables and fruits
will decrease LDL cholesterol concentrations by 0.10 mmol/L. **-10**
mmol/L is the true regression coefficient \\(\beta_{X}\\) for this
association.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#           Prepare simulated measures           #
# ********************************************** #

set.seed(1)

# generate the 'true' value (no random errors)
  X  <- rnorm(n=5000, mean=5, sd=1)
  
# generate independent random errors
  E1 <- rnorm(n=5000, mean=0, sd=1.3)
  ## change seed that have different values of random error
  set.seed(2)
  E2 <- rnorm(n=5000, mean=0, sd=1.3)
  
# Add random errors to the 'true' value to derive X measured "on a given day"
  W1 <- X+E1
  W2 <- X+E2
  
    ## For plausibility, truncate negative
    ## values at 0 (i.e., cant have negative intakes)
    W1 <- ifelse(W1<0,0,W1)
    W2 <- ifelse(W2<0,0,W2)
    
# generate a linear relationship based on X
  b0 <- 3.0 # hypothetical average LDL cholesterol in this sample
  b1 <- -0.10 # hypothetical relationship between vegetables and fruits and cholesterol
  EQ <-  b0 + b1 * X
  Y  <-  rnorm(n=5000, EQ, sd=0.5)
```

The proportion of total variance due to random errors for vegetables and
fruits intakes is approximately 62% for \\(W_1\\) and 61% for \\(W_2\\). This is
consistent with dietary intake data on a given day where a majority of
the total variance is simply due to within-individual variations from
one day to another (i.e., random errors). In other words, the majority
of the variance for dietary intakes measured on a given day is caused by
people eating a bit differently each day for random reasons.

## Assess relationship using a linear regression model

First, I assess the relationship based on the naive analysis which
considers the measured vegetables and fruits **on a given day** as if it
reflects long-term/usual intakes. Then, I repeat the analysis with the
**true** value, i.e., vegetables and fruits intake measured without
errors that correctly reflect long-term/usual intakes.

Typically, we would not know the true vegetables and fruits intakes.
This would require observing the actual intakes of many individuals over
may days or months! Plus, had we known the true intakes, we would not
need to apply measurement error correction as there would be no errors
to correct.

``` r
# ********************************************** #

    X           |       -0.11 | 6.89e-03 | [-0.13, -0.10] |  -16.24 | < .001

### Regression coefficient of \\(\beta\prime_{W_j}\\) vs. true association

The naive analysis indicates that a 1-serving increase in vegetables and
fruits is associated with a 0.04 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol
concentrations (95%CI, -0.05, -0.03). However, the analysis based on
true intakes rather indicates that a 1-serving increase in vegetables
and fruits is associated with a 0.11 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol
concentrations (95%CI, -0.13, -0.10), which is consistent with the
simulated association. The naive analysis shows a 2.8-fold attenuation
of the true relationship. This observation is consistent with theory
regarding the impact of one independent variable measured with
(classical) random errors on an estimated regression coefficient (Keogh
et al. 2020).

### Standard error of \\(\beta\prime_{W_j}\\) vs. true association

A noteworthy observation is that the standard error of the naive
analysis is 1.6-fold **smaller** than the standard error of the true
simulated association. Consequently, the estimated confidence interval
for the naive analysis is narrower than the confidence interval of the
true simulated association. The naive association not only
underestimates the true association effect size, but it also produces an
incorrectly narrow (and falsely precise) confidence interval.

It is good practice to look at the raw data before further analyses.

### Hand calculation

For the present demonstration of one independent variable measured with
error (vegetables and fruits) in a linear regression model, the biased
regression coefficient of the naive analysis can be calibrated directly
using the following equation (Keogh and White, 2020):

$$ \beta_X = \beta\prime_{W_J}/\lambda$$

which reads as: the *unbiased* (calibrated) regression coefficient of
the association between vegetables and fruits and LDL cholesterol
\\(\beta_X\\) equals to the *biased* (naive) regression coefficient obtained
with measured vegetables and fruits on a given day \\(\beta\prime_{W_J}\\)
divided by the correction factor \\(\lambda\\).

The question is then, how can we estimate the correction factor
\\(\lambda\\)? This is the purpose of regression calibration. As shown in
Keogh and White (2020), we can estimate the correction factor \\(\lambda\\)
by the regression of the replicate measurement \\(W_{j=2}\\) on the first
measurement \\(W_{j=1}\\). The equation is:

$$ W_{i,j=2} = \beta_0 + \boldsymbol{\lambda} W_{i,j=1} +\gamma Z_i+\epsilon_i$$

For the present demonstration, there are no covariates \\(Z_i\\) and the
equation simplifies to

$$W_{i,j=2} = \beta_0 + \boldsymbol{\lambda} W_{i,j=1} +\epsilon_i$$

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#     Hand calculation of correction factor      #
# ********************************************** #

# Regression of the second measurement (repeat) on first measurement
rc <- 
  glm(formula = VF_day2 ~ VF_day1, # had we considered covariates, we should have included them
      family  = gaussian("identity"),
      data    = VF_simstudy)

  ## Show parameters
  parameters::model_parameters(rc)
```

    Parameter   | Coefficient |   SE |       95% CI | t(4998) |      p
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    (Intercept) |        3.09 | 0.07 | [2.96, 3.23] |   44.71 | < .001
    VF day1     |        0.39 | 0.01 | [0.37, 0.42] |   29.74 | < .001

``` r
  ## Output correction factor (lambda)
  lambda <- parameters::model_parameters(rc)[2,2]

# Show correction factor
  lambda
```

    [1] 0.3920149

Finally, we can calibrate the regression coefficient of the naive
analysis (\\(\beta\prime_{W_J=1}=\\) -0.04) by dividing it by the correction
factor \\(\lambda=\\) 0.392. Once calibrated, we find that the regression
coefficient should be -0.102, which is consistent with the true
association!

### The `mecor` package

Fortunately, we don’t have to calculate everything by hand. The `mecor`
R package (Nab et al. 2021) can be used to calibrate a regression
coefficient using repeated data of the independent variable measured
with error. Using `mecor` is more efficient than the hand calculation
above, as the package accommodates a wide range of scenarios and
incorporates variance estimation.

The code below illustrates how to apply regression calibration with
`mecor`. For demonstration purpose, the `method=standard` is used to
show results consistent with traditional regression calibration, but
other relevant methods can be used.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#          Reg. calibration with mecor           #
# ********************************************** #

library(mecor)

model_mecor <- 
mecor::mecor(formula = LDL_cholesterol ~    # outcome
               MeasError(VF_day1, replicate = (VF_day2)) , # replicate measurement
             method = "standard",           # standard = regression calibration
             data = VF_simstudy)            # data

model_mecor
```


    Call:
    mecor::mecor(formula = LDL_cholesterol ~ MeasError(VF_day1, replicate = (VF_day2)), 
        data = VF_simstudy, method = "standard")

    Coefficients Corrected Model:
    (Intercept) cor_VF_day1 
      3.0064694  -0.1019799 

    Coefficients Uncorrected Model:
    (Intercept)     VF_day1 
     2.69087911 -0.03997762 

``` r
# Show confidence intervals for the corrected estimate (delta method)
  summary(model_mecor)$c$ci
```

                 Estimate       LCI       UCI
    (Intercept)  3.006469  2.890262  3.122677
    cor_VF_day1 -0.101980 -0.124810 -0.079150

Upon application of the measurement error correction (via standard
regression calibration), we find that the coefficient of regression for
the association between vegetables and fruits and LDL cholesterol is
-0.102 mmol/L per 1-serving increase in vegetables and fruits intake.
This is almost exactly the true association, as per the simulation, and
equal to the ‘manual’ analysis above.

[Bootstrap variance
estimation](https://didierbrassard.github.io/posts/2022/10/blog-post-4/)
can also be performed within `mecor` with the `B=...` option.

# Conclusion

Thanks to Nab et al. (2021), regression calibration is relatively simple
to implement in `R`, as well as other types of measurement error
correction. I must point out that dietary intake data often have other
issues that were not dealt with in this simple demonstration. For
example, dietary intake data are often skewed which may require
transformation to satisfy the classical measurement error assumptions.
Covariates were also not considered, but they would have to be included
in the regression calibration model (Keogh and White 2014, Keogh et
al. 2020). Also, study objectives are often much more complex; for
example, many variables measured with error are often considered
together in the same model. Nonetheless, I think the simple example
above illustrates the importance of considering the impact of random
errors and the relevance of measurement error correction methods.

For nutrition analyses in particular, I find the [NCI
methods](https://prevention.cancer.gov/research-groups/biometry/measurement-error-impact/software-measurement-error)
currently provide the most comprehensive measurement error correction
software. However, these methods are mainly available in `SAS`.
Fortunately, the *Markov Chain Monte Carlo* multivariate method has also
been made available for use in `R`.
