In this nutrition data visualization series, I aim to show how to
visualize common statistics in health and nutrition. Or, at least, how I
think it is best to visualize these data.  
In this article, I focus on the case where we are interested in the
distribution of intakes. You can skip the next section to see
visualization code only.

# Data overview

For the purpose of this blog, I use dietary intake data that have
already been modelled to reflect usual intakes and were taken from [the
evaluation of the Healthy Eating Food Index
(HEFI)-2019](https://didierbrassard.github.io/publication/2022-05-10-APNM2022b).
These data are based on publicly available data from the [Canadian
Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2015 -
Nutrition](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/82M0024X2018001).

    ##                      297

The data has percentile values arranged in the “long format” (i.e., on
each row; from percentile 1 to 99), by component of the HEFI-2019 (1 to
10) and strata (Both sexes, 2-18 y; Males, 19y+; and Females, 19y+).

# Simple plot: distribution for one continuous variable

Say that we would like to visualize the score distribution for the
*Vegetables and fruits* HEFI-2019 component and for kids and adolescents
only. An histogram with a density curve would be appropriate for such
purpose.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#         Plot 1x histogram using base R         #
# ********************************************** #

hist(distrib[distrib$strat3==1 & distrib$c==1 ,]$value,
     main = "Distribution of HEFI-2019 score\n Kids and adolescents, 2-18 y",
     xlab = "Vegetables and fruits (/20), points")
```

<img src="/images/2022-10-13-blog-post-3_files/figure-gfm/simple-histogram-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#         Plot 1x histogram using ggplot         #
# ********************************************** #

  distrib |>
  # note: use data from kids and adolescents only AND 1st component
  dplyr::filter(strat3==1 & c==1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=value),stat="identity") + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, aes(y=..density..), colour="black",fill="white") +
  geom_density(kernel="gaussian",fill="black",alpha=0.1) + 
  labs(title="Distribution of Vegetables and fruits HEFI-2019 component score",
       subtitle="Kids and adolescents 2-18 y, CCHS 2015-Nutrition",
       y = "Density",
       x = " Vegetables and fruits score (/20), points")
```

<img src="/images/2022-10-13-blog-post-3_files/figure-gfm/simple-histogram-2.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

However, we might want to visualize all 10 HEFI-2019 component scores.
For this purpose, one could generate 10-times one histogram for each
component and paste them together in an external software like
Powerpoint.  
I actually used to do this during my graduate studies. I tried to line
up all plots as best as I could. Needless to say that this was a tedious
task. Plus, as soon as I had to update my analysis, I had to copy/paste
all plots all over again, line them up and so on. Not only was this very
inefficient, it was also error-prone. Indeed, despite double-checking,
it was very easy to forget updating values for one plot for example.

Fortunately, there is an elegant solution to this problem: the
`facet_wrap` option in the `ggplot` package!

# Efficient plot: distribution for many continuous variables

For this example, we still focus on kids and adolescents only, but we
will plot all component scores in one figure.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#       Plot many histograms using ggplot        #
# ********************************************** #

  distrib |>
  # note: use data from kids and adolescents only, but include ALL 10 components
  dplyr::filter(strat3==1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=value),stat="identity") + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, aes(y=..density..), colour="black",fill="white") +
  geom_density(kernel="gaussian",fill="black",alpha=0.1) + 
  facet_wrap(~c_f, scales="free",nrow=2) +
  # note: in <facet_wrap>, we must indicate that axis should be independent from one another using <scales="free">,
  #since HEFI-2019 components do not always have the same total 
  labs(title="Distribution of HEFI-2019 component scores",
       subtitle="Kids and adolescents 2-18 y, CCHS 2015-Nutrition",
       y = "Density",
       x = "Component score, points")
```

<img src="/images/2022-10-13-blog-post-3_files/figure-gfm/efficient-histogram-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The `facet_wrap` option of the `ggplot` package allows us to plot 10
histograms using only one line of code. Further customization is also
possible (axis lines, range for values). No more manual “lining-up”! No
more tedious copy-paste! Once I discovered `facet_wrap`, I never went
back to creating plot manually.

# Efficient plot 2: distribution for many continuous variables and many groups

We can add one layer of complexity to the plot above by considering all
groups at once instead of focusing only on one group (i.e, children and
adolescents).  
For example, one might be interested in comparing distribution among
groups. In this case, it is best to plot the distribution we wish to
compare in the same plot. To avoid overplotting, we keep only the
density curves in the plot below and remove histograms.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#     Plot many density curves using ggplot      #
# ********************************************** #

  distrib |>
  # note: use data from all strata AND all 10 components
  ggplot(aes(x=value, group=strat3_f),stat="identity") + 
  geom_density(aes(fill=strat3_f,colour=strat3_f),kernel="gaussian",alpha=0.3) + 
  facet_wrap(~c_f, scales="free",nrow=2) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.direction = "horizontal") +
  labs(title="Distribution of HEFI-2019 component scores",
       subtitle="Respondents 2y or older, CCHS 2015-Nutrition",
       y = "Density",
       x = "Component score, points")
```

<img src="/images/2022-10-13-blog-post-3_files/figure-gfm/efficient-histogram2-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can see that the distribution for `Beverages` and `Free sugars` are
particularly skewed towards lower score for children and adolescents
compared with adults. Of note, had we been interested in **differences**
across percentiles, a different plot may have been more relevant.
Indeed, the current plot does not allow us to quickly grasp the extent
of differences among subgroup distribution. Regardless, I find amazing
that we can produce a graph with great complexity with only a few lines
of code!

# Efficient plot 3: cumulative distribution for many continuous variables and many groups

Finally, we can also show cumulative distribution. Admittedly, I find
cumulative distribution a bit more difficult to interpret when used with
many subgroups as in the example below. Perhaps we should focus on one
group only. However, cumulative distribution plots have the advantage to
show directly the percentile values. For example, for the *Vegetables
and Fruits* score distribution (first component), we see that 10 points
(/20) is approximately the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile (median), the
63<sup>th</sup> percentile and the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of Females
19y+, Males 19y+ and kids/adolescents 2-18y, respectively.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#   Plot cumulative distributions using ggplot   #
# ********************************************** #

  distrib |>
  # note: use data from all strata AND all 10 components
  ggplot(aes(x=value,y=p, group=strat3_f),stat="identity") + 
    # note: <p> indicates percentile value for each X (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ... 99)
  geom_line(aes(colour=strat3_f,linetype=strat3_f),size=1.2) + 
  facet_wrap(~c_f, scales="free_x",nrow=2) + 
    # note: because percentile values are common for each component, we use "free_x" only
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.direction = "horizontal") +
  labs(title="Cumulative distribution of HEFI-2019 component scores",
       subtitle="Respondents 2y or older, CCHS 2015-Nutrition",
       y = "Density",
       x = "Component score, points")
```
