A common data manipulation task involves transposing data from a
**long** (portrait) to **wide** (landscape) format, and vice versa. This
manipulation is sometimes necessary to accommodate statistical
procedure, but also to aggregate and combine variables in a data. In
nutrition, a typical example is combining **repeated** dietary intake
data. For example, study participant may have completed 2 or 3 24-hour
dietary recalls each and we may wish to calculate average intakes among
repeated assessments. While this manipulation can be done manually in
Excel, having reproducible code is [advantageous for many
reasons](https://didierbrassard.github.io/posts/2023/08/blog-post-5/).
The purpose of this blog is to introduce these common data format and
demonstrate how we can go from one format to another using `R`, as well
as nutrition data example.

# The difference between long vs. wide data format

## Long (portrait) data

In a long data, repeated information are stored **vertically** as shown
in [Table 1](#tbl-long).

<div id="tbl-long"></div>

| Participant_id | Assessment | Food_1 | Food_2 | Food_3 | Food_j… |
|---------------:|:-----------|-------:|-------:|-------:|:--------|
|              1 | First      |      2 |      1 |      9 | …       |
|              1 | Second     |      1 |      3 |      4 | …       |
|              2 | First      |      4 |      4 |      5 | …       |
|              2 | Second     |      2 |      1 |      3 | …       |
|              3 | First      |      2 |      7 |      6 | …       |
|              3 | Second     |      4 |      3 |      6 | …       |
|              4 | First      |      5 |      4 |      5 | …       |
|              4 | Second     |      5 |      2 |      7 | …       |
|              5 | First      |      6 |      4 |      2 | …       |
|              5 | Second     |      4 |      3 |      5 | …       |

Table 1: Data in the long format where repeated assessments appear
vertically

The long format simplifies variable names especially when there are
many, since the index of the repeated assessment appears as a variable
on its own. This is an advantage of this format that may facilitate data
manipulation. The number of repeated assessment per individual is easy
to obtain, often directly with basic procedure.

``` r
# How many assessment per participant? 
table(data_long$Assessment)
```


     First Second 
         5      5 

I find relatively easier to transform data from the long format to the
wide format (next). In doubt, I suggest you opt for a long format to
collect or prepare your data.

## Wide (landscape) data

In a wide data, repeated information are stored **horizontally** as
shown in [Table 2](#tbl-wide). Notice that only one observation per
`Participant_id` appears on each row despite having two assessments. The
wide format requires including the index of the repeated assessment in
each variable’s name, which makes variable naming slightly more
cumbersome.

<div id="tbl-wide"></div>

| Participant_id | Food_1_First | Food_1_Second | Food_2_First | Food_2_Second | Food_3_First | Food_3_Second | Food_j…\_First | Food_j…\_Second |
|---------------:|-------------:|--------------:|-------------:|--------------:|-------------:|--------------:|:---------------|:----------------|
|              1 |            2 |             1 |            1 |             3 |            9 |             4 | …              | …               |
|              2 |            4 |             2 |            4 |             1 |            5 |             3 | …              | …               |
|              3 |            2 |             4 |            7 |             3 |            6 |             6 | …              | …               |
|              4 |            5 |             5 |            4 |             2 |            5 |             7 | …              | …               |
|              5 |            6 |             4 |            4 |             3 |            2 |             5 | …              | …               |

Table 2: Data in the wide format where repeated assessments appear
horizontally

The advantage of the wide data is that operations across repeated
assessment are relatively easier to perform, e.g., mean of
`Food_1_First` and `Food_1_Second`. The wide format also simplifies
merging manipulation, especially when we wish to combine data that do
not include repeated assessment (e.g., participant characteristics that
would not change like baseline age or biological sex) with data that
include repeated assessment (e.g., the repeated dietary data as shown
above).

The number of (unique) individuals is easy to obtain in the wide format.
Using `nrow(data_wide)`, we find that there are 5 individuals.

With such a small data, the benefits of learning code are not obvious.
However, reshaping data from hundreds of participants, each with
multiple repeated assessment and many variables, would be very hard to
perform efficiently and without errors. The next section illustrates how
code can be used to reshape such data.

# Simulated data for demonstration

In this example, I use a simulated data named `dietary_data` which
includes **1000** participants, each with **3** repeated measurements,
and **3** dietary variables named **energy, fiber, and vf**. To show a
data similar to that of real life, 5% of participants have missing
values for recalls on day 2 or day 3. All in all, the data look similar
to summary intakes one would get after collecting repeated food records
or 24-hour dietary recalls for example. Of note, the data currently
appears in the **long** format, where repeated observations are stored
vertically.

[Table 3](#tbl-summary) presents means, standard deviation, min and max
values of variables in `dietary_data`.

# Reshape from long to wide

Suppose we wish to calculate mean intake values based on the 3 dietary
recalls, but we also want to retain the information of each recall
individually. Before calculating mean inakes, we would have to transpose
data.

I find the `pivot_wider` function from `tidyr` package is the simplest
solution for this task. New variable names have to include the repeated
observation identifier, i.e. the recall index in this example
(variable=`day`). The new variable names will have the following general
structure: `X_r1`, `X_r2`, `X_r3` for recalls 1, 2, and 3, respectively,
and where `X` is replaced by energy, fiber, or vf.

As you can see, reshaping data from long to wide can be done with only a
few lines of code. For this reason, I prefer to have my “analysis-ready”
data in this format rather than in the wide format. We can now summarize
intakes based on recall-specific variables.

There are many different methods (base R, tidyverse) to calculate
row-wise means, i.e., the mean values between the columns in the data
for each observation or participant.

## Calculate row-wise means with base R

First, here is one base R approach using `rowMeans`. Note that
`na.rm=TRUE` must be added, otherwise, participants with missing day 2
or day 3 would all have `NA` for mean energy.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#      Calculate mean energy inake - base R      #
# ********************************************** #

# Calculate mean energy intakes using base R
energy_mean_r123 <-
  rowMeans(dietary_data_w[c("energy_r1", "energy_r2", "energy_r3")], na.rm=TRUE)

# Summary
summary(energy_mean_r123)
```

       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
       1166    2050    2278    2293    2515    3665 

## Calculate row-wise means with tidyverse

Second, here is the tidyverse approach which I use more often because I
find it easier to scale up for many variables or many recalls.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#    Calculate mean energy inake - tidyverse     #
# ********************************************** #

# load library for mutate, and others
library(dplyr)

# Calculate mean energy intakes using tidyverse approach
dietary_data_w_mean <-
  dietary_data_w |>
  dplyr::rowwise() |> # note: indicates that the averaging process should be performed across observations rather than columns
  dplyr::mutate(
     "energy_mean_r123" := mean(dplyr::c_across(dplyr::starts_with("energy")),na.rm=TRUE)
  )

  # warning: there shouldn't be variables with a name that start with 'energy' beyond the recall-specific values.

# Summary
summary(dietary_data_w_mean$energy_mean_r123)
```

       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
       1166    2050    2278    2293    2515    3665 

Both base R and tidyverse approach give the same values in the end.

### Using a function

Ideally, we would push this one step further and create a function to
easily calculate or means for different variables. The advantages of
using a function are 1) you can re-use the function for future analyses;
2) you can more easily add new variables without copy/pasting; 3) you
only have to change code once if you need to expanded the function
(i.e., calculate other statistics than average) or if you made an error
at some point. Here is a brief example of such function and its
application to calculate mean intakes.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#         1) Function to calculate means         #
# ********************************************** #

library(dplyr)

calculate_mean <- function(data, variable_prefix){
data_with_mean <-
  data |>
  dplyr::rowwise() |> # note: indicates that the averaging process should be performed across observations rather than columns
  dplyr::mutate(
    "{paste0(variable_prefix,'_mean')}" := mean(dplyr::c_across(dplyr::starts_with(variable_prefix)),na.rm=TRUE)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(ends_with('_mean'))

return(data_with_mean)

}

# ********************************************** #
#      2) Create vector of variable prefix       #
# ********************************************** #

variable_prefixes <- c("energy", "fiber", "vf")

# ********************************************** #
#      3) use <lapply> to loop the function      #
# ********************************************** #

result_list <- 
  lapply(variable_prefixes, function(prefix) {
    calculate_mean(data = dietary_data_w, variable_prefix = prefix)
  })

# ********************************************** #
#            4) prepare a final data             #
# ********************************************** #

means_among_recalls <- 
  dplyr::bind_cols(result_list)

# Merge with data including recall-specific values
dietary_data_w_means <-
 cbind(dietary_data_w,means_among_recalls)

# Overview 
dim(dietary_data_w_means); names(dietary_data_w_means)

dietary_data data

# Reshape from wide to long

It is not uncommon to have data stored in the wide format. In this case,
we may wish to transpose variables so they appear in the long format
which is often required for statistical procedure or visualization
purpose. For this process, the key is having **consistent variable
names**.

Say we have one variable for energy intake measured over 3 dietary
recalls:

- **Consistent** naming pattern: `energy_r1`, `energy_r2`, `energy_r3`
- **Inconsistent** naming pattern: `day1_energy`, `Day2_Energy`,
  `energyDaythree`

Hopefully, this is already the case and you don’t have to change many
variable names. However, if you face inconsistent naming pattern, the
package `janitor` and `janitor::clean_names()` might be useful to save
time.

Another consideration is to keep **only** the variables you want to
transpose and necessary identifiers. In the present example, this means
`participant` (participant identifier) and the dietary variables of
interest with recall index. If you have multiple time points each with
multiple recalls, you would have to keep the time point identifier
variable to track which records belong at which time point (not shown
here).

I find the `pivot_longer` function from `tidyr` package is the simplest
solution as it works in the opposite direction than `pivot_wider`.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#           Reshape from wide to long            #
# ********************************************** #

library(tidyr)

dietary_data_l <-
  dietary_data_w |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = names(dietary_data_w)[-1], # i.e., the variable we want to transpose = all, but <participant> (first)
    names_to  = "variable", # i.e., the name of the column where original variable names are copied
    values_to = "value" # i.e., the name of the column where variable values are copied
  )

# overview
dim(dietary_data_l); names(dietary_data_l); head(dietary_data_l,10)
```

    [1] 9000    3

    [1] "participant" "variable"    "value"      

    # A tibble: 10 × 3
       participant variable    value
             <int> <chr>       <dbl>
     1           1 energy_r1 1828.  
     2           1 energy_r2 1809.  
     3           1 energy_r3 2162.  
     4           1 fiber_r1    14.4 
     5           1 fiber_r2    14.3 
     6           1 fiber_r3    18.9 
     7           1 vf_r1        2.79
     8           1 vf_r2        3.57
     9           1 vf_r3        4.15
    10           2 energy_r1 2750.  

We see the format of the `dietary_data_l` data is even “longer” than the
original long data we had. We could say that we have reshaped from a
**wide** format to a **long-long** format. In some cases, the long-long
may be exactly what you need. For demonstration purpose, I show how to
go back to the original (simple) long data.

``` r
# ********************************************** #
#         Reshape from long-long to long         #
# ********************************************** #

# load package
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Go back to original version of <dietary_data>
dietary_data_original <-
  dietary_data_l |>
  # 1) split variable names and recall index
  tidyr::separate_wider_delim(
    cols = variable,
    delim = "_",
    names = c("varname", "recall_index")
    ) |>
  # 3) reshape from long-long to (simple) long
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "varname", # i.e., the column that has the variable names
    values_from = "value"   # i.e., the column that has the variable values
  )

# overview 
dim(dietary_data_original); names(dietary_data_original); head(dietary_data_original, 10)
```

# Conclusion

I hope these examples help you save some time if you need to perform
these common manipulations. Sometimes, I find it difficult to
intuitively know the results of a given reshaping procedure beforehand.
Thus, I may use trial and errors until I can obtain the desired format.
To avoid the headache of obtaining a given format, I recommend investing
time into creating functions that do exactly what you need, so that you
can re-use these procedures in your project.

The flow chart below summarizes the tidyverse-way of reshaping dietary
intake data.

Finally, if you need to perform these manipulations on very large
dataset, it may be worth using the
[`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)
package and the `data.table::dcast` function in particular for a
significant gain in processing speed.
